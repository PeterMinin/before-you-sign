# Before You Sign

This assistant should give you an idea of what you're agreeing with in another EULA, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy or other typical document you'd otherwise probably accept without reading.

Based on LLMs (obviously), so no guarantees, just a best-effort.

Design sketch:
- Primarily local, ideally with the option to use commercial models.
- Web interface. Just enter the document, get a summary. Optionally, ask follow-up questions.
- Input formats: plain text, PDF, DOCX, images.
- Multi-lingual: potentially different models for different languages.
